# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm

Goal of this program: Solve the Traveling-Salesman Problem

Approach: Genetic Algorithm

### Some important notes:
1. I set the population size for each generation = 31. 
	15 will be kept by Tournament selection, 
	15 will be generated by single-point crossover, 
	1 will be generated by swap mutation
2. After a generation is randomly produced, 100 runs of genetic algorithm will be applied
3. On top that, I also add another while loop to look for a local minimum, the step size = 5

For example,

  if the shortest path after 100 runs of genetic algorithm is 12000 (path(100)), it'll also look the shortest path after 105 runs (path(105))

  if path(105) < path(100), look path(110)

  if path(110) < path(105), look path(115), etc

  if path(110) >= path(105), output path(105)
